# Eclipse Scout One Day Tutorial

This repository contains my work from the **Eclipse Scout One Day Tutorial (ODT)**,  
which I completed as part of a project at work. Since I was new to **Eclipse Scout**,  
this tutorial helped me get familiar with the framework and its concepts.

## About the Project

The tutorial covers the basics of **Eclipse Scout**, a framework for developing modern business applications.  
It includes setting up the environment, creating a Scout project, and understanding its structure.  

## Setup

To run this project, you need:  

- **Java 17+** (e.g., from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/))
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (or another IDE with Maven support)
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **Eclipse Scout SDK** (via dependencies, no Eclipse IDE required)

## Notes

Since this was my first experience with Eclipse Scout, this repository reflects my learning process while working with **IntelliJ and Maven** instead of the typical Eclipse setup.  
Please note that my work is not perfect and there are some things that didn't worked as shown in the Tutorial.   
Feel free to use it as a reference if you're exploring Scout with a similar stack!
